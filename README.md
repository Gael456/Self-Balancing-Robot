## Project Goal
- Design a self-balancing robot that keeps a platform level
  - Maintain a 0&deg; angle while the base is tilted or disturbed
- Apply embedded systems concepts on an Arduino based platform
  - Read pitch and roll from an MPU6050 IMU over the I2C bus

## Background and Methodology

Implemented in Arduino C/C++, this project has achieved the following:

- Design and build a **two-axis self-balancing robot** to keep a platform level while the base is tilted or disturbed
  - Use a pan-tilt servo bracket to provide independent **pitch** and **roll** motion
  - Top plate sized for a standard cup and mounted so the center of mass is near the middle of the platform
 
- Integrated an **MPU6050 IMU** with the Arduino over the **I2C bus**
  
- Calibrates IMU offsets at startup (platform must be kept still during calibration)

- IMU angles are read using mpu.getAngleX()/getAngleY() (AngleX → pitch, AngleY → roll)
  - Uses a simple **low-pass filter** on the IMU angles to smooth measurements
    - `angle_filt = angle_filt + α(angle_raw - angle_filt)`

- Error is computed as: `error = setpoint - filtered_angle`
  
- Implemented a **Proportional control algorithm** to stabilize the platform
   - Target setpoints are `0° pitch` and `0° roll`
   - Two proportional controllers (pitch and roll): `u = Kp * error`
   - Includes a small deadband around `0°` to reduce jitter and noise-induced motion
   - Servo outputs are centered and constrained to safe limits to prevent over-rotation/binding
   - Servo command per axis `Cmd = center + u`

- Integrated the complete system on a single prototype platform
